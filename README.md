# Interview_coding

The questions and topics related to the ones you've asked cover a range of common interview topics in programming and problem-solving. Here are some similar questions that might be asked in an interview:

1. String Manipulation:

  - Reverse a string without using built-in functions.
  - Check if a string is a palindrome.
  - Find the first non-repeating character in a string.
  - Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
  - Implement string compression (e.g., convert "aaabbbccc" to "a3b3c3").

2. Array Manipulation:

  - Implement the FizzBuzz problem.
  - Find the maximum subarray sum.
  - Rotate an array by a given number of steps.
  - Remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place.
  - Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

3. Recursion:
  - Implement factorial calculation using recursion.
  - Write a recursive function to compute Fibonacci sequence.
  - Implement a recursive function to calculate the sum of digits of a number.
  - Write a recursive function to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem.
  - Use recursion to generate all permutations of a string.

4. Data Structures:
   
  - Implement a stack using an array or linked list.
  - Implement a queue using an array or linked list.
  - Implement a binary search tree (BST) and its operations (insertion, deletion, search).
  - Implement a hash table (hash map) from scratch.
  - Implement a trie (prefix tree) for efficient string searching.

5. Algorithmic Problem-Solving:

  - Find the longest common subsequence between two strings.
  - Implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.
  - Implement binary search algorithm.
  - Solve the "Knapsack problem" using dynamic programming.
  - Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort, mergesort) and analyze its time

6. Mathematics and Logic:

  - Find the prime factors of a number.
  - Check if a number is a power of two.
  - Implement Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
  - Write a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation.
  - Solve probability or combinatorics problems.
